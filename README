Why Russell's 5-minutes-ago hypothesis?
=======================================

Because moving backed-up configuration files to a new system makes
the system behave as if it was configured after a long period of time.
Bertrand Russell's hypothesis states that the world might have been
created 5 minutes ago together with all our memories of previous events.
